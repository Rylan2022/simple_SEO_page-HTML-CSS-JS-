# Responsive Web Design with HTML, CSS, and JS

## Overview

This repository provides a simple template for creating a responsive web design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Responsive web design ensures that your website looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/responsive-web-design.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd responsive-web-design
   ```

3. **Open in a Code Editor:**
   Use your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) to open the project files.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity.

## Responsive Design

The template includes media queries in the `styles.css` file to make the design responsive. Media queries allow you to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as its width.

```css
/* Example Media Query for Mobile Devices */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Add styles for small screens here */
}
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fit your project requirements. Add additional sections, modify styles, or enhance functionality as needed.

## Testing

Test your responsive design on various devices and browsers to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience.

## Deployment

Once you are satisfied with your design, deploy it to your preferred hosting platform.
